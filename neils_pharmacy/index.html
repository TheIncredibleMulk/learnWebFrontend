        <p>
          <ul>
           <li>40 mL XO brandy</li> 
           <li>30 mL Cointreau (triple-sec)</li>
           <li>30 mL sweet red vermouth</li>
           <li>5 dashes orange bitters</li>
           <li>135 mL Grapefruit Soda (do not use infused water) </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <p class="recipe-card-title">Instructions</p> 
        <br>
        <p>
            Combine brandy, cointreau, vermouth, and bitters in a shaker.  Shake lightly until chilled.  Do not overshake.
            Strain into a tall tumbler with new large ice cubes.
            Add grapefruit soda and stir lightly to mix.
            Garnish with an orange slice if desired.
            <br>            
            Notes:  This recipe was created using brandy, but bourbon or whiskey can be substituted in quite well.  Bourbon produces a smoother flavor and an overall milder cocktail.  Other brands of triple sec will work alright but the cointreau will give the best flavor of the drink.
            The recipe was created with "Q" grapefruit soda and is the recommended brand to utilize, however, other brands will work. Please just make sure to use a true soda.

        <ul>
           <li>22 mL (¾ oz) Dry Gin </li> 
           <li>22 mL Campari</li>
           <li>22 mL Sweet Red Vermouth</li>
           <li>22 mL Herbal Liqueur (Elderflower or Benedictine)</li>
        </ul>
        <br><br>
        <p class="recipe-card-title">Instructions</p> 
        <br>
        <p>
        Combine all ingredients in a rocks glass with large ice.
        Stir to chill and combine.
        <br>
        Notes:  The herbal liqueur can be either of the options listed, however, benedictine has proved to lend a more complex and satisfying flavor to the drink.
        If you are looking to alter this flavor try using different types of gin! Different varieties can lend a surprisingly different complexity and flavor profile depending on the botanicals and level of juniper.

      <ul>
         <li>  120 mL Tonic Water</li>  
         <li>75 mL Gin</li>  
         <li>25 mL Elderflower Liqueur</li>  
         <li>7 dashes Peychaud’s bitters</li>  
         <li>1 lime</li>         
      </ul>
      <br><br>
      <p class="recipe-card-title">Instructions</p> 
      <br>
      <p>
        Slice 2 thin lime wheels from a clean lime and place in a tall glass with ice.<br>
        Squeeze juice from the rest of the lime into the glass. <br>
        Add elderflower liqueur, gin, and tonic water to glass.  <br>
        Add bitters to the glass. <br>
        Stir lightly to combine. <br>
      <br>
      Notes:  Any dry gin will work for this recipe but out of the gins tested the best options were Plymouth and Bombay Sapphire. <br>
      I recommend that you use "Fever-Tree" tonic water. The Refreshingly Light or Premium Indian works best in my opinion.  They come in convenient mini cans. <br>
      If you don't have access to the liqueur, an elderflower tonic water will come close to the desired taste. <br>
